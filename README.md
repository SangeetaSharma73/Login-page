# 🎉 Login Page with Audio Feedback 🎉

- This project is a simple Login Page application built using Tkinter (for the graphical user interface) and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to provide audio feedback on successful login. It also validates user inputs for login credentials to ensure the username and password meet specific criteria.

## 🚀 Features 🚀

- Interactive Login Page 🖥️ built with Tkinter.
- User Validation 🔐:
  1. Username contains only alphabets 🌐.
  2. Password must include letters, digits, and special symbols 🎯.
- Welcome Audio 🎧 generated by gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech).
- Error Handling ⚠️ to guide users in case of invalid input.

## 🌐 Requirements 🌐

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- gTTS (pip install gTTS)
- playsound (pip install playsound)

## 💡 Installation 💡

1️⃣ Clone the repository:
   `git clone https://github.com/SangeetaSharma73/Login-page.git`

2️⃣ Install the required dependencies:

🌟 Usage 🌟
1. Login Page: The GUI will prompt for your username and password.
- Usernames should only contain alphabets 🅰️.
- Passwords should have letters, digits, and symbols for enhanced security 🔑.
2. If credentials are valid, you'll hear a welcome message 🎶.
3. If credentials are invalid, you'll get an error message 💥 guiding you to correct it.
4. Once successfully logged in, the welcome audio 🎶 will play, and the fields will be cleared 🧹.

## ⏭️ Code Explanation ⏭️

### ⭐ Main Components ⭐

1. Tkinter: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
  - A Label is used to display the title and input prompts.

2. Entry fields are provided for entering the username and 💥 password.
3. A Button is used to trigger the login validation.

- gTTS: Converts the "Welcome" message into an audio file (welcome.mp3), which is played using the playsound 🎧 library.

- Input Validation: The application checks:

1. If the username contains only alphabetic characters.
2. If the password is at least 8 characters long and contains a mix of letters, digits, and symbols.
